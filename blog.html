                  <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h3>
                  My main troubles in tackling this first assignment were pretty much just the setup of everything.
                  I wasn't able to push to Github correctly at first because I had misunderstood the cloning process.
                  I also had never worked with html, so I did not know that it could just be viewed in a browser.
                  Figuring out that simple fact was probably the hardest part of the assignment. Thankfully, Atom is great at helping me format.

                  <h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
                  I did not know anything coming into this class in terms of HTML or git or GitHub, so all of this was new for me.
                  <br><br>
                  <h3>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment?</h3>
                  The most useful resource was simply going to class. I followed along on my computer when we were discussing how to set up GitHub.
                  This made it much easier to remember everything afterwards, since I did it once in class.
